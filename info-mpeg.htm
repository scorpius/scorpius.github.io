   <strong>Bitrate</strong><br>
   Increasing the bitrate gives higher quality and bigger file size. In other
   words, it is directly proportional to both the file size and quality.
   Example:<br>
   Your animation has 400 frames and you want to encode at 25fps. A bitrate of
   1,000,000 bits/sec will produce a 2,000,000 byte file (excluding the header,
   packets, and other chunks of junk).<br>
   400frames/25fps = 16 seconds<br>
   1,000,000 bits/sec = 125,000 bytes/sec<br>
   16 seconds x 125,000 bytes/sec = 2,000,000 byte mpeg file (~1.9MB).<br>
   <strong><br>
   Frame rate<br></strong>Decreasing the frame rate will increase the file size
   (inversely proportional) and will have no effect on quality. The minimum
   should be 24 fps, to avoid flickering.<br>
   <strong><br>
   GOP sequence (IPB)<br></strong>Increasing the I frames in the GOP will
   increase quality and file size. Increasing P and B frames will do the
   opposite. I frames are like keyframes; P and B frames depend on them in
   order to be decoded. I frames are compressed/degraded the least and since P
   and B are derived from I frames, they are degraded to a greater extent.<br>

   I'm not an mpeg-encoding expert and some of this info may contain errors. If
   you have corrections or any other tips, let me know. A good free mpeg
   encoder: <a href="http://www.tmpgenc.com">tmpgenc</a>.
