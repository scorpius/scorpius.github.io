    I re-modeled my golfball with MoI, a new nurbs-based modeler. <a href=
    "large/golf-blurred.jpg"
       class="highslide"
       onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img src="thumb/golf-blurred.gif"
         alt="MoI Nurbs GolfBall"
         align="left"
         border="0"
         hspace="10"
         vspace="5"
         width="134"
         height="110"
         name="pic10"
         id="pic10"></a> The result is a much more accurate surface, at the
         expense of a polygon count that has increased by a factor of 10. At
         the screen resolution shown, the difference is not noticeable, but at
         print resolution (or in extreme closeup renders) the difference in the
         dimple quality becomes clear.

   <p class="indent">
    I rendered this image (in 23 minutes) with SunFlow and used single-bounce
    path-tracing, along with focal blur to create an added depth effect and
    extra realism. This scene has about 17 million faces.

    This object is an inverted quintrino that was constructed with <a href=

         The image is an animated gif that shows the original mesh, and one
         that has been subdivided twice.

    I rendered this image with SunFlow and used ambient occlusion along with an
    infinite plane to create a seamless background. It takes on the appearance
    of a star-like sea creature.

    My latest creation is a photo-realistic Soccer Ball, modeled entirely with

         id="pic8"></a>Wings (my first model), and rendered with Blender. I
         attempted to create a subtle radiosity effect by using multiple
         lights. Note the diffuse lighting on the right side, and the fact that
         you can't tell where the shadows begin or end.

    Two Wings3D tutorials are available for this object: one deals with the
    modeling, and the other deals with UV texturing using the powerful autouv
    feature. Both are available in the Info section.

    Here is an exact model of a <i>Spalding Top-Flite PLUS</i> golf ball. It
    was modeled and rendered entirely with Blender 1.80a, has 492 dimples, and
    consists of approximately 61,000 vertices and 83,000 faces. The model is a
    direct result of my deep interest in geometrical forms, Blender's
    incredibly outstanding mesh editing tools, and my own ingenious
    technique.<a href="large/cornell-golf.jpg"
       class="highslide"
       onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img src="thumb/cornell-golf.gif"

         name="pic7"
         id="pic7"></a>
   </p>

   <p class="indent">
    Note the subtle shading on the dimples that are indirectly illuminated, the
    soft shadows, and the color bleeding. This is a result of Blender's
    radiosity solver. Also note the specular highlights on the ball. This was
    done by setting the 'Ref' value to zero (so as not to disturb the radiosity
    solution) and increasing the 'Spec' and 'Hard' values (to provide a phong
    highlight). This procedure added highlights that accurately depict the hard
    plastic shell of a golf ball.

    Now you can view this as a low-poly scene (682 faces) in RealTime. Click on
    the window that opens and use the arrow keys on the keypad. Press the
    'Hkey' to toggle the help screen. Available as an <a href=

    This is a model of the time travel device from the TV series <em>Seven
    Days</em> (TM &amp; Copyright 1998-2001 by Paramount Pictures<a href=

    The whole image&#8212;from the text to the background&#8212;was created

    This is my first attempt at polygon modeling. Since I'm interested in
    polyhedra and geodesic domes, I decided to try and make the blue spherical
    device, which fascinated me from the very first time that I saw it. I'm
    proud of the way this image turned out, and would appreciate any comments.
    The grey image to the right was rendered with Sunflow using plain ambient
    occlusion.

    To the left is my first image created with Blender 1.74a. It's a standard
    torus knot made out of a garden hose! Even though this looks like a simple
    scene, I've worked <a href="large/torusknot1.jpg"
       class="highslide"
       onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img src="thumb/torusknot1.gif"
         alt="A Torus Knotted Garden Hose"

         height="110"
         name="pic1"
         id="pic1"></a> very hard on it. The garden hose texture is my own
         custom painted image map (with a corresponding bump map, of course). I
         made the object itself by extruding a bezier circle along the path of
         a nurbs curve. I never know what to put in the background, so I
         experimented with Blender's built in cloud and marble functions until
         I got the gradient look that I <a href="large/torusknot2.jpg"
       class="highslide"
       onclick="return hs.expand(this)"><img src="thumb/torusknot2.gif"

         id="pic2"></a>wanted. As with all of my images, no post-processing was
         used.
   </p>

   <p class="indent">
    To the right is my second image done completely in Blender 1.74a. It is
    another type of torus knot, but this time I decided to use outer space for
    the background, so I experimented with the marble function until I got a
    subtle circular gradient. I think it adds more depth to the image and makes
    the knot look less flat. This one is my personal favorite. Below you will
    find some more variations of Torus Knots with different textures applied.
