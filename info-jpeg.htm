   <strong>Eliminate JPEG Artifacts</strong><br>

   <br>
   <strong>Sampling</strong><br>
   To eliminate jpeg artifacts, set the horizontal and vertical component
   sampling factors to 1x1. Sadly, Blender and most other jpeg encoders default
   to 2x1 and do not allow it to be changed. This little known trick yields the
   highest possible quality for jpeg, with a very slight increase in file size.

   <strong>Quality Factor<br></strong>Never use a quality factor higher than
   95, it usually inflates the file size and makes no visible difference. A
   quality factor of 100 combined with 2x1 sampling will produce more artifacts
   than a quality factor of 95 with 1x1 sampling.<br>
   <br>
   This technique, with emphasis on the sampling factors, should greatly reduce
   banding that occurs in areas of gradients and other blocky-atifacts that
   appear near edges and areas of high contrast. It also works wonders for
   screen grabs of dialog boxes and for delicate line art. However, as rendered
   images become more and more realistic (due to radiosity &amp; global
   illumination, procedural textures that replicate natural patterns, etc.) the
   1x1 sampling trick doesn't have as much effect as it used to. But it will
   always have its uses.

   CJPEG users can adjust the sampling with this command:<br>
   <em>cjpeg -progressive -opt -qual 95 -sample 1x1 name.tga name.jpg</em>
