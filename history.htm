    A really short history of how I became involved<br>
    with Ray Tracing and Graphics
   </p>

   <hr>

   <p>
    Sometime around 1991, I was <a href=
    "http://www.nls.fi/~vsaari/raytrace/jpeg/pacman.jpeg"><img src=
    "thumb/pacman.gif"
         alt="Pacman.jpg"
         align="right"
         border="0"
         hspace="10"
         vspace="5"
         width="134"
         height="110"></a>at my friend's house and he downloaded this PacMan
         scene (Copyright &copy; 1991 <a href="mailto:vs@iki.fi">Ville
         Saari</a>) from a local BBS in South Jersey with his new 2400 BPS
         modem. I did not have a computer at that time and I did not even know
         that POV-Ray existed, but the image completely amazed me. I wouldn't
         see another ray-traced image for several more years.

    In 1994, I saw this ice cream scene<a href=
    "http://www.povray.org/ftp/pub/povray/Hall-Of-Fame/sundae.gif"><img src=
    "thumb/sundae.gif"
         alt="Sundae.gif"
         align="left"
         border="0"
         hspace="10"
         vspace="5"
         width="134"
         height="110"></a> (Copyright &copy; 1994 <a href=
         "mailto:ram@iu.net">Robert A. Mickelsen</a>) in CompuServe Magazine. I
         read the article abount POV-Ray and downloaded the program
         immediately. After reading the docs and playing with the examples, I
         ran into Pacman.pov and I remembered that I saw it years ago. Now it
         all started to fall in place. These images inspired me to create the
         puzzle models that you can see on the gallery page.
